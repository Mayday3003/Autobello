<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  In this part you are going to work as a group to find information about the
  main concepts of this project
</p>
<h5>Electric energy</h5>
<p>
  is the energy derived from electric potential energy or kinetic energy of the
  charged particles. In general, it is referred to as the energy that has been
  converted from electric potential energy. <br />
  <br />
  The basic unit of electrical energy is the joule or watt-second. An electrical
  energy is said to be one joule when one ampere of current flows through the
  circuit for a second when the potential difference of one volt is applied
  across it. The commercial unit of electrical energy is the kilowatt-hour (kWh)
  which is also known as the Board of trade unit (B.O.T).<br />
  <br />
  1 kwh = 1000 × 60 × 60 watt – second <br />
  1 kwh = 36 × 105 Ws or Joules <br />
  Generally, one kwh is called one unit. <br />

<p>
    <h5>Watt (physical unit)</h5>
  Unit of power in the International System of Units (SI) equal to one joule of
  work performed per second, or to 1/746 horsepower. An equivalent is the power
  dissipated in an electrical conductor carrying one ampere current between
  points at one volt potential difference. It is named in honour of James Watt,
  British engineer and inventor. One thousand watts equal one kilowatt. Most
  electrical devices are rated in watts. <br />
  The Watt commonly indicated by the sign 'W'. <br />
  The basic unit of 1 watt is equivalent to 1 J/s. <br />

      <h5>Scatter plot</h5>
    Are the graphs that present the relationship between two variables in a
    data-set. It represents data points on a two-dimensional plane or on a
    Cartesian system. <br> <br>
    overplotting:When we have lots of data points to plot, this can run into the
    issue of overplotting. Overplotting is the case where data points overlap to
    a degree where we have difficulty seeing relationships between points and
    variables.

     <h5>Linear regression</h5>
    Analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of
    another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent
    variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value
    is called the independent variable.

<h5>Renewable energy</h5>
    Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished
    at a higher rate than they are consumed <br />
    Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being
    replenished
  </p>
  <p>
    Solar energy: Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources and
    can even be harnessed in cloudy weather. The rate at which solar energy is
    intercepted by the Earth is about 10,000 times greater than the rate at
    which humankind consumes energy.

  <p>
    Wind energy: Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air by using
    large wind turbines located on land (onshore) or in sea- or freshwater
    (offshore). Wind energy has been used for millennia, but onshore and
    offshore wind energy technologies have evolved over the last few years to
    maximize the electricity produced - with taller turbines and larger rotor
    diameters.
