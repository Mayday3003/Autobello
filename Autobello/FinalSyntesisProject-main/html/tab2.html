<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>

<ul>
  <p>
    The presented graph shows a significant increase in electricity consumption
    over a period of 5 months in the public services bill. It is important to
    note that a direct relationship between variable x (months) and variable y
    (consumed KWh) can be observed, indicating that as the months go by, the
    consumed KWh increase. In addition, it can be noted that the graph has a
    positive slope, suggesting a constant increase in electricity consumption.
    <br />
    <br />
    When analyzing the data for each month individually, it can be observed that
    the beginning of the period shows a consumption of 126KWh in electricity. In
    the second month, although not as significant, a considerable increase in
    electricity consumption is presented with an increase of 10KWh compared to
    the first month. For the third month, the consumption decreases to the same
    amount as in the first month, being 126KWh. For the fourth month, the KWh
    consumption remains constant and finally, in the fifth month, a considerable
    increase in electricity consumption is presented, with an increase of 11KWh,
    reaching up to 137KWh.

  <h5>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month
  </h5>
  <p>
    $$ y= 1.20 \cdot 6 + 126.60 $$ $$ y= 133.8 \text{ kWh} $$
  </p>

  <h5>
    conclusion
  </h5>
  <p>
    In conclusion, although the same amount of KWh was consumed in three months,
    sudden increases occurred, creating a peak in electricity consumption, and
    due to this, it is expected that KWh will continue to increase for the
    following month. Finally, these increases can be attributed to the constant
    use of electrical devices and, therefore, a lack of awareness regarding
    energy savings. It is important to consider that electricity consumption is
    one of the main factors that contribute to climate change and, for this
    reason, it is vital to make a more efficient and responsible use of
    electricity.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  By carrying out a point-by-point analysis of the data, several interesting
  observations can be made. Firstly, it can be seen how linear regression has a
  direct relationship with both the x and y variables. This means that as one
  variable increases, so does the other variable, and vice versa. Additionally,
  there is a particular case that is worth examining in detail: in one of the
  houses with four residents, a consumption of 239 KWh is recorded, exceeding
  even a property with a larger number of residents, where 221 KWh is consumed.
  This suggests that the house with four inhabitants either has excessive
  consumption, or conversely, that the property with six people has very low
  consumption. <br />

  Furthermore, it is possible to highlight that each property has a unique
  energy consumption range, which appears to be largely influenced by the number
  of residents living in the property. For example, in properties with two
  residents, energy consumption ranges between 115 and 137 KWh. In houses with
  three inhabitants, the range extends from 127 to 222 KWh. In properties with
  four residents, consumption varies between 110 and 239 KWh, while in houses
  with five inhabitants, consumption is 192 KWh. Finally, in the house with six
  residents, consumption is 221 KWh. <br />

  It is important to note that these variations in consumption ranges can be
  attributed to a variety of factors. For instance, differences in household
  size, behavior, and lifestyle can all impact energy consumption. Additionally,
  the age and efficiency of appliances, as well as insulation and heating
  systems, can also play a role in the amount of energy consumed by each
  household.

    how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people
    live.
  </h5>
  <p>$$ y= 22.80 \cdot 200 + 85.86 $$ $$ y= 4645,86 \text{kWh}$$</p>
  <h5>
    conclusion
  </h5>
  <p>
    In conclusion, it is evident that there is a considerable difference between
    the points where the same number of residents exist, which can explain the
    variations in the consumption ranges mentioned above. However, it is
    important to highlight that despite these differences, the graph maintains a
    positive slope, indicating that there is a clear relationship between the
    number of residents and electricity consumption. Further research may be
    needed to better understand the factors contributing to energy consumption
    in each household, and to identify potential solutions for reducing energy
    usage across properties with varying numbers of residents.
